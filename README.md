Experimenting with vim

This repo has the files that are included in ~/.vim

In ~/.vim there is also a file named vimrc. This is where should be placed all the info that normally are placed in ~/.vimrc
So, in every new installation 2 things should be done:
```
clone <repo_url> ~/.vim
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
